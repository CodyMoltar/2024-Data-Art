Today in Media History, we learned about the invention of the printing press. It's crazy to think how much one invention changed the world.  Suddenly, information could be spread much faster and further.  I wonder what invention today will be seen as revolutionary in 500 years. Maybe AI like the one I'm writing on now? That's kind of a scary thought. I need to do more research on Gutenberg.
