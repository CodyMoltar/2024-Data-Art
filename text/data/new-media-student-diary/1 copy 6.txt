We had a debate in class today about the ethics of deepfakes. It's insane how realistic they can be now.  It makes you question whether you can believe anything you see online anymore.  One student argued that deepfakes could be a form of art, but I'm not so sure.  It seems like they could be used for a lot of harmful things.
