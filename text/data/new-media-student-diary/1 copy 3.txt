Professor Lee showed us this bizarre short film today. It was all these distorted images with unsettling music, and I honestly wasn't sure what to make of it.  Some people in class were saying it was a commentary on consumerism, but I thought it was more about the fragmentation of the self in the digital age.  Or maybe I'm just overthinking it. I should ask Professor Lee what they intended.
