Started reading McLuhan's "The Medium is the Massage" for my media theory class.  It's pretty dense stuff, but I'm starting to get the idea that the way we consume media is just as important as the content itself.  Like, watching a movie on your phone is a totally different experience than seeing it in a theater.  I need to find some videos explaining McLuhan's ideas.
