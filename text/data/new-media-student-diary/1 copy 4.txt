Spent hours in the editing lab trying to get this video project just right.  I'm starting to get the hang of Final Cut Pro, but it's still a steep learning curve.  The biggest challenge is choosing the right music. It can totally change the mood of a piece. I think I'll go browse some royalty-free music sites before bed.
