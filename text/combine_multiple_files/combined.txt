We had a workshop today on creating interactive media.  We learned how to use basic coding to make a website where users can click on different elements to change the content.  It was challenging, but kind of fun.  Maybe I should take a coding class.


Went to a new media art exhibit downtown.  There were some really thought-provoking pieces.  One was an installation with a bunch of screens showing different news feeds all at once, and it was completely overwhelming.  It made me think about how we're constantly bombarded with information in the digital age.


I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the different software I need to learn for this program.  There's Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere Pro... it's a lot to keep track of.  I need to create a schedule to practice each one regularly.


Had a fascinating discussion in class today about the impact of social media on politics.  It's crazy how much influence these platforms have.  We talked about the spread of misinformation and the formation of echo chambers.  It's important to be critical of what you see online.


I'm working on a project about digital identity.  It's interesting to think about how we present ourselves online versus in real life.  Social media allows us to curate our own image, but it can also create a lot of pressure to present a perfect version of ourselves.


We watched a documentary today about the history of the internet.  It's amazing how quickly it's evolved.  From dial-up modems to high-speed wireless connections, it's completely transformed the way we communicate and access information.


I'm starting to realize that new media is constantly changing.  What's cutting-edge today might be outdated tomorrow.  It's important to stay curious and keep learning new skills.


I need to start thinking about my final project for this semester.  I'm thinking about doing something with virtual reality.  It's a really immersive technology with a lot of potential for storytelling.


We had a lecture today about the future of new media.  The professor talked about things like artificial intelligence, the metaverse, and transhumanism.  It's exciting to think about the possibilities, but also a bit daunting.


Today in Media History, we learned about the invention of the printing press. It's crazy to think how much one invention changed the world.  Suddenly, information could be spread much faster and further.  I wonder what invention today will be seen as revolutionary in 500 years. Maybe AI like the one I'm writing on now? That's kind of a scary thought. I need to do more research on Gutenberg.


I'm feeling inspired to create something truly innovative.  I want to use my skills to make a positive impact on the world.  Maybe I can use new media to raise awareness about important social issues.


This program is definitely challenging, but I'm loving every minute of it.  I feel like I'm learning so much and developing valuable skills that will prepare me for a career in the exciting field of new media.








Professor Lee showed us this bizarre short film today. It was all these distorted images with unsettling music, and I honestly wasn't sure what to make of it.  Some people in class were saying it was a commentary on consumerism, but I thought it was more about the fragmentation of the self in the digital age.  Or maybe I'm just overthinking it. I should ask Professor Lee what they intended.


Spent hours in the editing lab trying to get this video project just right.  I'm starting to get the hang of Final Cut Pro, but it's still a steep learning curve.  The biggest challenge is choosing the right music. It can totally change the mood of a piece. I think I'll go browse some royalty-free music sites before bed.


Had a guest speaker today who's a social media manager for a big company.  He talked about how they use data analytics to target specific audiences.  It's fascinating how much information they gather on people.  Makes me wonder what they know about me.  I think I'll check my privacy settings on Instagram later.


We had a debate in class today about the ethics of deepfakes. It's insane how realistic they can be now.  It makes you question whether you can believe anything you see online anymore.  One student argued that deepfakes could be a form of art, but I'm not so sure.  It seems like they could be used for a lot of harmful things.


Started reading McLuhan's "The Medium is the Massage" for my media theory class.  It's pretty dense stuff, but I'm starting to get the idea that the way we consume media is just as important as the content itself.  Like, watching a movie on your phone is a totally different experience than seeing it in a theater.  I need to find some videos explaining McLuhan's ideas.


I'm starting to think about what I want to specialize in. There are so many options in new media:  filmmaking, animation, graphic design, web development, social media marketing... the list goes on and on.  Maybe I should try to get some internships in different fields to see what I like best.


My friend showed me this cool app today that lets you create augmented reality experiences.  You can basically overlay digital images onto the real world through your phone's camera.  It's amazing what technology can do these days.  I wonder if I could use that for a project somehow.


I'm really enjoying the collaborative aspect of this program.  We get to work on a lot of group projects, and it's great to bounce ideas off other creative people.  I've learned so much from my classmates.
